                Algebra is the branch of mathematics that helps in the representation of problems or situations in the form of mathematical expressions. It involves variables like x, y, z, and mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to form a meaningful mathematical expression. All the branches of mathematics such as trigonometry, calculus, coordinate geometry, involve the use of algebra. One simple example of an expression in algebra is 2x + 4 = 8.
                
                Algebra deals with symbols and these symbols are related to each other with the help of operators. It is not just a mathematical concept, but a skill that all of us use in our daily life without even realizing it. Understanding algebra as a concept is more important than solving equations and finding the right answer, as it is useful in all the other topics of mathematics that you are going to learn in the future or you have already learned in past.
                
                What is Algebra?
                Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with symbols and the arithmetic operations across these symbols. These symbols do not have any fixed values and are called variables. In our real-life problems, we often see certain values that keep on changing. But there is a constant need to represent these changing values. Here in algebra, these values are often represented with symbols such as x, y, z, p, or q, and these symbols are called variables. Further, these symbols are manipulated through various arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, with an objective to find the values.

                The above algebraic expressions are made up of variables, operators, and constants. Here the numbers 4 and 28 are constants, x is the variable, and the arithmetic operation of addition is performed.
                
                Branches of Algebra
                The complexity of algebra is simplified by the use of numerous algebraic expressions. Based on the use and the complexity of the expressions, algebra can be classified into various branches that are listed below:
                
                Pre-algebra
                Elementary Algebra
                Abstract Algebra
